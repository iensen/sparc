%% s_crossing.sp -- SPARC version of the missionaries and cannibals

%% For a quick result, invoke with 
%%    java -jar sparc.jar s_crossing.sp -A -solver clingo | mkatoms
%% However, since SPARC doesn't understand #show yet, you may want to wait for 
%%    java -jar sparc.jar s_crossing.sp -A -solveropts "-pfilter=occurs" | mkatoms
%% As always, piping the output to mkatoms is optional but nice.

%% Three missionaries and three cannibals come to a river
%% and find a boat that holds at most two people. If the
%% cannibals ever outnumber the missionaries on either bank,
%% the missionaries will be eaten.
%% How can they all cross?
